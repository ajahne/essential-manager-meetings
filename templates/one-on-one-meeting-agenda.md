# A One-On-One Meeting Agenda
_(in process)_

This is a "boilerplate" meeting agenda for one-on-one meetings.  Edit and adapt to suit your voice, rhythm, company culture, and people. 

## Agenda
- **General Catch up** (5-10 minutes)
  - How are you doing? How is the week going?
  - _spend a few minutes getting to know your direct report better_
- **Employee's Agenda** (30 minutes)
  - Questions I typically start with to get the ball rolling (use _one_, switch it up)
    - What is on your agenda? 
    - What is top of mind?
    - How would you best like to spend this time today?
  - Listen, takes notes, follow up, and ask questions
- **Follow up with items on your agenda** (10 minutes)
  - Note, it is _their_ meeting and most of the time should be spent on their agenda
- **Feedback** (10 minutes)
  - Ask for feedback
  - Provide feedback/coaching 
    - (make sure you start with showing you can take feedback first before giving it)
- **Follow up and next steps** (5 minutes)
  - outline and share next steps are neccessary

## Additional information
- Meeting Length: 60 minutes  
- Frequency: Weekly
- Meeting topics include: priorities, roadblocks, accomplishments, frustrations, feedback, and what is “top of mind” for your direct report; it is **not** a status update
- Take notes (ask your direct report if they would like a copy of the notes); follow up
- Switch the meetings up! (Go for a walk, have breakfast, grab a coffee, etc.)
