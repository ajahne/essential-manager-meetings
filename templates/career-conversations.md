# Career Development Conversations
Three one hour coversations spread out roughly two weeks apart. 

## Meeting One: Life Story - take an hour to get to know your employees 
> Starting with kindergarten, tell me about your life. 

During the conversation
- Take notes, listen and ask questions
- Look for the patterns over the course of your people's lives that give you strong signal and just write them down
- Find the values, motivators, what the employee cares about

## Meeting Two: Dreams - ask your employee about their dreams, bring the lighthouse into focus
> Ask what this person would be doing at the pinnacle of his or her career — when they’re feeling challenged, engaged and not wanting anything else.

Three questions to help bring things into focus
- What size company do you imagine working for?
- What industry do you want to be in?
- Do you want to be in a very senior individual contributor type role or very senior management type role?

## Meeting Three: Career Action Plan
> Map out — in great detail — exactly how your employee is going to reach that vision for themselves.

Each part has 2-5 action items. Each action item should answer: Who will do what by when?

Four Steps to Design a Career Action Plan
- Develop their role
- Enhance their network
- Define their immediate next step
- Enlist others to help hone their skills
