## Initial one-on-one meeting questions:
- General:
  - How are you doing? 
  - If someone is new to the company/team/squad/etc.
    - How's the first week been?
    - What are you most excited about?
    - Any surprises since you have joined, good or bad, which I should know about? 

- Feedback & Recognition
  - How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
  - What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback? Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it, or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback?

- Grumpiness
  - What makes you grumpy?
  - How will I know when you’re grumpy?
  - How can I help you when you’re grumpy?
  - How do I know when you’re in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of?

- Manager
  - Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate?
  - What do you need from your manager?

- Support 
  - What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
  - What do you need from your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)
  - What do you need from your peers? (outside the team)

- Career and Goals:
  - What motivates you? What are your motivations?
  - What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?
  - Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them?

- The way they work
  - When do you feel the most productive? (time of day)
  - Do you have a preference on when you would like to have 1-1 meetings? In the morning/afternoon, what works best for you (Managers, do not assume..ask!)
  - How do I know when you are in the "zone"? (e.g. headphones on, slack messages on away") - I want to avoid interruptions when people are in their "maker mode"

- Most important:
  - What is your favorite way to treat yourself?  
  - What's the your current favorite tv show/album/artist/sports team/videogame/other?
  - What is your favorite emoji? 

## Additional thoughts
- This is a conversation, not a checklist.  These questions are meant to open up discussion and not about speeding through. For example, if you ask someone what motivates them and they talk about it, which leads to an example of a project that they are proud of...ask what made them proud...ask about the project!
- To the above point, the ultimate goal is to understand your teammate better
- There are a lot of questions here and if you are following the above points, it might take 1 or 2 (maybe 3) one-on-one sessions. That is FINE and I would encourage that! 
  - If you have an hour for your one-on-one you can probably get through these questions in one session, but if you have 30 minutes, it may take a couple and that's cool! Again, its a conversation, not a checklist!
- Ask these questions in your own words...for example, I may not ask "what makes your grumpy" word for word, instead I may say "So, how do I know when you are in a bad mood?", then talk about that and transition to "OK, so what are some things that may put you in a bad mood or make your grumpy".
